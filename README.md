# tldr-pages.github.io

This repository holds the website for the [tldr project](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr),
hosted at http://tldr-pages.github.io.

## Implementation notes

The reason this is a separate repository is to allow the url to be `tldr-pages.github.io`
[rather than](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages)
the more verbose `tldr-pages.github.io/tldr` if it was hosted in the main repository.

## Credits

The style of the website is the [Solo theme](https://github.com/chibicode/solo),
available under the [MIT License](http://chibicode.mit-license.org/).
